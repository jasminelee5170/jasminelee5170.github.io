                    <p> Jasmine Lee is an architecture student at Carnegie Mellon University. She has always been interested in design from a young age. Her first oil painting was done at the age of 10, and she has chosen it as her media of choice since. She has always been inspired by the history that she finds around her-- whether it is the houses down the block, the sweet old ladies next-door, or the century-old subway lines running through her neighborhood.</p>
                    <p> Her inspirations for her work come from her experiences. Her most memorable trips are roadtrips with friends and family, and family-friends. She paints with the intention of capturing the memories of her happiest times, even when in seemingly mundane circumstances.</p>
                    <p>In her final years of high school, Lee started brancing out into different types of media. She explored with the potential of oil pastels, gouache, and graphite, producing several mixed media pieces. She has been in love with this combination ever since.</p>
